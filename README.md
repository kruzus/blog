# Simple Blog

In this project I am learning the basics of React and MySQL DB with Node and Express.


## How to start
First we need mysql DB installed with database called 'blog', you can rename it to your own desire. 

Second, we need GUI if you want, if you're pro VIM programmer you can use whatever you want to see the database contents. 

Thirdly, once everything is set up, we can run npm install on /server and /view foders it's going to install its dependencies.

At last we can run npm start on both folders. It should run the server and open react view. 

# Todo 

- [ ] Finish server
- [ ] Finish the UI
- [x] Setup the API to display data in view
- [ ] Make functioning POST view

### Notes: 
needs more work
